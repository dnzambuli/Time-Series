# Question

**PACKAGES:** forecast and tseries

## 1. Load the Air Passengers data set in R. (2 marks)

```{r}
library(forecast)
library(tseries)
```

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
AirPassengers
```

```{r}
data = data.frame(
  Year = as.character(rep(seq(1949, 1960, 1), each  = 12)),
  Month = (rep(c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May",
                "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct",
                "Nov", "Dec"), times = 12)),
  Passangers = as.numeric(AirPassengers),
  t = seq(1: length(AirPassengers))
)
head(data)
```

## 2. Plot the time series. Comment on any visible trends, seasonality, or anomalies that might affect your modeling strategy. (3 marks)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    YearMonth = paste(Year, Month)
  )

year_breaks <- data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(start_t = min(t))
```

```{r}
january = data %>% filter(Month == "Jan") %>% pull(t)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = t, y = Passangers)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Air Passengers Between 1949 and 1961",
    y = "Passengers"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = january, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "darkgreen")+
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (Year-Month)",
                   breaks = year_breaks$start_t,
                   labels = year_breaks$Year)+
  theme_minimal()
```

> **Observation**
>
> The data seems to be seasonal.
>
> -   **January** has the lowest number of passengers. represented by
>     the `vertical red line`
>
> -   The middle of the year has the highest value within the year.
>
> -   There is a spike at the beginning of the year. This spike drops
>     down then rises up to the peak of the year.
>
> -   The second drop of the year is the most severe leading to the next
>     January having the lowest number of air passengers in the next
>     year.
>
> -   After January there is a slight drop before rising for the rest of
>     the year.
>
> The data has an **observable upwards trend** represented by the green
> line

## 3. Check the stationary of the Air Passengers time series. (3 marks

```{r}
adf.test(data$Passangers, alternative = "stationary")
```

> because the parameter measure is **stationary**
>
> $H_0$ The data is non-stationary. This implies that the statistical
> properties of the series, such as the mean and variance, are dependent
> on time.
>
> $H_1$ The data is stationary. This means the statistical properties of
> the series, such as the mean and variance, are constant over time and
> do not depend on when the observations were taken.
>
> Because the p-value is $\lt 0.05$ we **reject the null hypothesis**
> and conclude that the data is stationary.

## 4. If the series is non-stationary, apply necessary transformations to make it stationary. Show the transformed series. (3 marks)

> The data is stationary
>
> because of this there is no need for transformation to make the data
> stationary

## 5. Use the ACF and PACF plots to suggest possible values of 𝑝 and 𝑞 for an ARMA model on the stationary series. (3 marks)

### ACF plot

```{r}
acf(AirPassengers, lag.max = 45,main = "ACF plot of passangers between 1949 and 61")
```

> Lags up to lag 40 are significant
>
> **Expectations**
>
> -   **Positive spikes:** Indicate a positive correlation with past
>     values.
>
> -   **Negative spikes:** Indicate a negative correlation with past
>     values.
>
> -   **Quick decay to zero:** Suggests a short-term dependency.
>
> -   **Slow decay to zero:** Suggests a long-term dependency.
>
> **Observations**
>
> The spikes are becoming smaller and smaller.
>
> -   This means that there is a negative correlation between the past
>     values and the predicted future values.
>
> -   There is reasonably long-term predictable patterns from the data
>
> The first `40 lag` values. From this lags after 40 have little impact
> to prediction acting as noise.
>
> **Interpretation**
>
> -   The ACF decays slowly to zero, indicating a potential AR
>     component.
>
> -   There are no clear cuts off, suggesting a less prominent MA
>     component.
>
> **Because of this**
>
> -   **AR order (p):** 2 or 3 (based on the slow decay of the ACF)
>
> -   **MA order (q):** 0 or 1 (due to the lack of a clear cutoff)
>
> **Note** The ACF may need transformation because of the spikes as the
> lag spikes decrease

### PACF

```{r}
pacf(AirPassengers, lag.max = 45,main = "PACF plot of passangers between 1949 and 61")
```

> **Observation**
>
> -   **A spike at lag 1:** This indicates a strong direct relationship
>     between the current value and the previous value (lag 1)
>
> -   **No significant lag after lag 1** the relationship between the
>     current value and past values is primarily explained by the direct
>     relationship with the previous value.
>
> **Implications**
>
> -   **AR order (p):** 1 (due to the significant spike at lag 1)
>
> -   **MA order (q):** Likely 0, as there are no significant spikes in
>     the ACF plot

The **ARMA** model is likely a ARMA(1, 0) but it may have have noise
introduced by the seasonality.

## 6. Think about the seasonality in the original series. How might this influence your choice of p and q? (3marks)

-   **Misleading ACF and PACF:** Seasonality can introduce artificial
    patterns into the ACF and PACF plots, making it difficult to
    accurately determine the orders `p` and `q` for the ARMA model.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Model Underfitting:** If seasonality is ignored, the ARMA model
    might not capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to
    poor forecasting performance.

The predicted p and q need to be modified.

## 7. Based on your plots and seasonal considerations, fit an appropriate ARMA model. (4 marks)

### Stabilize variance by making

```{r}
data$stab_var = log(data$Passangers)
```

### Remove annual seasonality

```{r}
data$no_annual_sn = c(rep(NA, 12), diff(data$stab_var, lag = 12))
```

### Remove the seasons

```{r}
data$sec_dif = c(diff(data$no_annual_sn, lag = 1), NA)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = t, y = sec_dif)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Air Passengers Between 1949 and 1961",
    y = "Passengers"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = january, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "darkgreen")+
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Time (Year-Month)",
                   breaks = year_breaks$start_t,
                   labels = year_breaks$Year)+
  theme_minimal()
```

### ACF and PACF

```{r}
acf(ts(na.omit(data$sec_dif)),main = "ACF plot of passangers between 1949 and 61")
```

```{r}
pacf(ts(na.omit(data$sec_dif)),main = "PACF plot of passangers between 1949 and 61")
```

> **Observation ACF**
>
> **No clear pattern:** The ACF values fluctuate around zero without a
> clear pattern of decay or spikes. This suggests that there is little
> to no autocorrelation in the data.
>
> This suggests that the data might be relatively random with little
> dependence on past values
>
> **Observation PACF**
>
> There are significant spikes at lags 1 and 13. This suggests a direct
> relationship between the current value and the previous value (lag 1),
> as well as a potential seasonal effect at lag 13.
>
> The PACF values after lag 13 fluctuate around zero without a clear
> pattern, indicating that the relationship between the current value
> and past values is primarily explained by the direct relationship with
> the previous value and the seasonal component.
>
> **Implication**
>
> -   **AR component:** The significant spike at lag 1 suggests an AR(0)
>     component in the model.
>
> -   **Seasonal component:** The significant spike at lag 13 indicates
>     a potential seasonal component with a period of 12 (monthly data).
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> my ARMA is AR(0), d(0), MA(1)

```{r}
arma_model = arima(ts(na.omit(data$sec_dif)), order = c(0, 0, 1)) # ARMA seasonal , seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 0), period = 12)

checkresiduals(arma_model)

### Confirm my conclusion using built in functions

```{r}
q7_auto_arma = auto.arima(ts(na.omit(data$sec_dif)), d = 0, max.d = 0, seasonal = FALSE)
summary(q7_auto_arma)
checkresiduals(q7_auto_arma)
```

### conclusion

The new graphs match the ones generated by the manual method.

Based on the built-in function, the ideal ARMA is AR(0), MA(1), d(0)

This matches the approximation from the ACF and PACF in the initial
inference

This means that the best arma is in-did `ARMA(0, 1)`

## 8. Fit an ARIMA model to the original Air Passengers series. Discuss your process to automatically select the best model. (4 marks)

*Auto-Regressive (p)* -\> Number of autoregressive terms.

*Integrated (d)* -\> Number of nonseasonal differences needed for
stationarity.

*Moving Average (q)* -\> Number of lagged forecast errors in the
prediction equation.

```{r}
auto.arima(AirPassengers, seasonal = F) # (RDocumentation, 2024)
```

> **Using the auto.arima**
>
> The resultant output has the following values
>
> 1.  AR(4)
> 2.  Integreated(d) 1
> 3.  MA(2)
>
> This module was inspired by (Pulagam, 2020) and (Lingaraj Biradar,
> 2021). They proposed the inclusion of auto arima functions in python
> and R because:
>
> 1.  In the basic ARIMA a person needs to perform differencing and plot
>     ACF and PACF graphs to determine these values which are
>     time-consuming
> 2.  For the case of Air passangers the seasonality also makes the ACF
>     and PACF output to be less accurate in predicting the P,Q, D and
>     p, q, d for ARIMA

```{r}
q8_arima = Arima(AirPassengers, order = c(4, 1, 2)) #, seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1,0), period = 12)
```

## 9. Display the model summary and interpret the results. Think about the ARIMA specifications of the model and if you agree with the choice. (5 marks)

```{r}
summary(q8_arima)
```

> **Observation**
>
> **Model Type**: ARIMA(4, 1, 2)
>
> -   **AR (4)**: The model includes four auto regressive terms. This

## 10. Perform diagnostic checks on your fitted ARIMA model. Are there any hidden patterns that might have been missed? (3 marks)

```{r}
checkresiduals(q8_arima)
```

## 11. Discuss the results of your diagnostic checks. Are there any indications that your model is not adequate? How would you address these issues? (4 marks)

`Yes there are indicators that the model is not adequate`

-   I Could add a seasonal ARIMA to account for the potential lag spokes
    in the data

-   There may be patterns in the residuals that are not accounted for

-   Solve for autocorrelation in the data and handle the autocorrelation

## 12. Generate and plot a 12-month forecast using your fitted ARIMA model. Consider the uncertainty in your forecast. (5 marks)

```{r}
forecst_Data = forecast(q8_arima, h=12)
```

```{r}
forcst_plot = data.frame(
  time = seq(145, 156),
  PointForecast = as.numeric(forecst_Data$mean),
  Lo80 = as.numeric(forecst_Data$lower[,1]),
  Hi80 = as.numeric(forecst_Data$upper[,1]),
  Lo95 = as.numeric(forecst_Data$lower[,2]),
  Hi95 = as.numeric(forecst_Data$upper[,2])
)

ggplot(forcst_plot, aes(x = time))+
  geom_line(aes(y = PointForecast), color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lo95, ymax = Hi95), fill = "orange", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Lo80, ymax = Hi80), fill = "green", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast with Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Forecasted Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```

> 1.  **Blue Line** represents the point forecast from the ARIMA model
>     for each future time point
> 2.  **Green Shaded Area** areas represent the 80% confidence intervals
>     for the forecast
> 3.  **Orange Shaded Area** 95% confidence intervals
>
> **Interpretation**
>
> The expansion of the confidence intervals over time, as seen from the
> widening bands, indicates increasing uncertainty in the predictions as
> you project further into the future.

## 13. Interpret the forecast results. How accurate are they, and what do they suggest about future values of the series? Discuss the limitations and potential improvements.(5 marks)

### Target

-   A lower $\sigma ^ 2$ indicates a better fit of the model to the data

-   Higher (less negative) log likelihood values indicate a better model
    fit

-   for **AIC** and **BIC**: Lower values generally indicate a better
    model. The relatively close values of AIC and BIC suggest a balance
    between model complexity and fit.

-   A positive ME indicates a tendency of the model to overestimate the
    data.

-   RMSE provides a measure of the average magnitude of the forecast
    errors. The value indicates how much the predictions deviate, on
    average, from the observed values.

-   ACF1 if autocorrelation of residuals at lag 1 is close to zero, it
    suggesting that there is little to no autocorrelation left in the
    residuals, which is desirable.

### Observed Values

-   **ACF1** is `-0.04509642`

-   **ME** is `6.51499`

**Limitations and Improvements**

1.  The model appears to fit the data reasonably well, as indicated by
    the low MASE and nearly zero ACF1
2.  The positive ME and very slight MPE suggest a slight over-fitting
    tendency
3.  There might be room for simplification or adjustment to reduce
    potential over-fitting or to capture more nuances in the underlying
    data pattern.

### A new model to try and improve the accuracy

To try and reduce the over-fit I have made a train and test set.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n = length(AirPassengers)
samp = sample(1:n, round(0.2 * n))

test_indices = rep(FALSE, n)
test_indices[samp] = TRUE
train_indices = !test_indices

test_data = AirPassengers[test_indices]
train_data = AirPassengers[train_indices]

test_len = length(test_data)
```

```{r}
auto.arima(train_data, seasonal = F)

```

```{r}
new_q8_arima = Arima(train_data, order = c(2, 1, 2))
summary(new_q8_arima)
```

### 

> The reduction in the
>
> 1.  ME
> 2.  RMSE
> 3.  ACF1
> 4.  MASE
>
> indicate that this new model is more accurate with less over-fitting.

## 14. Fit a seasonal ARIMA model to the Air Passengers data set (3 marks)

```{r}
seasonal_arima = auto.arima(AirPassengers)
```

```{r}
seasonal_arima
```

## 15. Compare the seasonal ARIMA model with the non-seasonal ARIMA model in terms of AIC/BIC values and forecast accuracy. Consider if seasonality is being captured adequately by the seasonal model.

|                                         | ARIMA(4, 1, 2) | New ARIMA(2, 1, 2) | SEASONAL ARIMA(2, 1, 1)(0, 1, 0)[12] |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **AIC**                                 | 1373.56        | 1148.73            | 1017.85                              |
| **BIC**                                 | 1394.3         | 1162.41            | 1029.35                              |
| **Forecast Accuracy** $\log likelihood$ | -679.78        | -569.36            | -504.92                              |

Using the log likelihood to test the fit of the model to the data
provided for training

**Models**

-   **ARIMA(4, 1, 2)**: A non-seasonal model with four autoregressive
    terms, one differencing step, and two moving average terms.

-   **New ARIMA(2, 1, 2)**: A simpler non-seasonal model with two
    autoregressive terms, one differencing step, and two moving average
    terms.

-   **Seasonal ARIMA(2, 1, 1)(0, 1, 0)[12]**: Incorporates both
    non-seasonal and seasonal components, with two non-seasonal AR
    terms, one non-seasonal differencing step, one non-seasonal MA term,
    one seasonal differencing step, and an implicit seasonal pattern
    modeled over a period (likely 12, which could represent months in a
    year).

**Expectation**

-   Higher (less negative) log likelihood values indicate a better model
    fit

-   Lower AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values are better. It
    balances model fit and complexity, with penalties for more
    parameters.

-   BIC(Bayesian Information Criterion) adds more penalties to the
    model. But the lower it is the better the model.

> **Observation**
>
> 1.  The Seasonal ARIMA model shows the lowest AIC, indicating it might
>     be providing a better fit with fewer penalties for complexity
>     compared to the others.
> 2.  Again, the Seasonal ARIMA model has the lowest BIC, suggesting it
>     is the most efficient model among the three in terms of balancing
>     goodness of fit and model simplicity.
> 3.  The Seasonal ARIMA model has the highest (least negative) log
>     likelihood value, indicating it fits the data better than the two
>     non-seasonal models.
>
> **Interpretation**
>
> -   The seasonal ARIMA model appears to be the most effective model
>     among the three, given its lowest AIC and BIC scores and the
>     highest log likelihood
>
> -   The shift from ARIMA(4, 1, 2) to New ARIMA(2, 1, 2) shows a

>
> -   However, the Seasonal ARIMA model, while more complex with its
